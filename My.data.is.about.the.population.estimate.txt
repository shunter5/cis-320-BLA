My data is about the population estimate. my goals is going to compare the population between years 2014 and 2015. More than that, i will make some graph in R. The potential outliners for my data  boxplot.stats(cis$popestimate2014)$outby changing the coef argument to 3 to identify suspected my data outliers.  boxplot.stats(cis$popestimate2014, coef = 3)$outI am going to do the same thing with my data with popestimate 2015The last step of my report is to do the graph for state of region and state of division        barplot(table(cis$STATE,cis$REGION), legend.text=TRUE)        plot(cis$STATE, cis$REGION)
